# React Modern Design Project (HooBank)

## Major Features

- Feature 1: business.
- Feature 2: Billing.
- Feature 3: Card Deals.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new React project**: You can do this by running `npx create-react-app my-app`, where `my-app` is the name of your new application.

2. **Navigate to your project directory**: Use the command `cd my-app` to navigate into your new project directory.

3. **Install Tailwind CSS**: Run `npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest` to install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies.

4. **Generate Tailwind configuration file**: Run `npx tailwindcss init -p`. This will create a `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project.

5. **Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production**: In your `tailwind.config.js` file, ensure the `purge` array points to any files that use Tailwind classes.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

6. **Include Tailwind in your CSS**: In your `src/index.css` file, use the `@import` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles.

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

7. **Run the project**: Finally, you can run `npm start` to start your React application with Tailwind CSS installed!
